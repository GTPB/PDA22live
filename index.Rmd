### Course Description

Mass spectrometry based proteomic experiments generate ever larger datasets and, as a consequence, complex data interpretation challenges. This course focuses on bioinformatics and statistics for peptide identification, quantification, and differential analysis. Moreover, more advanced experimental designs and blocking will also be introduced. The core focus will be on shotgun proteomics data, and quantification using label-free precursor peptide (MS1) ion intensities. The course will rely exclusively on free and user-friendly software, all of which can be directly applied in your lab upon returning from the course. You will also learn how to submit data to PRIDE/ProteomeXchange, which is a common requirement for publication in the field, and how to browse and reprocess publicly available data from online repositories.  The course will provide a solid basis for beginners, but will also bring new perspectives to those already familiar with standard data interpretation procedures in proteomics.



### Target Audience
This course is oriented towards biologists and bioinformaticians with a particular interest in differential analysis for quantitative proteomics.

### Prerequisites 

The participants should have a basic knowledge about mass spectrometry based proteomics. Experience in analysing proteomics data is an advantage, but not mandatory. The course does not require advanced computer skills.

You will also be requested to watch the following videos before attending the course:
